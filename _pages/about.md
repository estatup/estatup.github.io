     <p>Filipe V. Ferreira is a postdoc researcher at the School of Chemical Engineering/University of Campinas-Brazil. He has a background in synthesis and characterization of polymer (nano)composites for different applications such as tissue engineering and active packaging. He has been actively involved in research areas such as bone regeneration, wound healing, drug delivery, and biomedical packaging. Specifically, Self-assembly of nanoparticles and novel process routes for the preparation of porous materials to form novel nanostructured materials with useful properties have been explored. Biomimetic synthesis of polymers and biomolecules with inorganic materials is another closely related field of interest. The researches have resulted in several publications, he has authored more than 30 journal papers, 2 books, 1 book chapters, 1 patent; has an h-index=15, citations > 550.</p>
